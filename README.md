# grupo

Initialized using https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack

## Folder Structure

All the source code will be inside **src** directory. Inside src, there is client and server directory. All the frontend code (react, css, js and any other assets) will be in client directory. Backend Node.js/Express code will be in the server directory.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eambutu/grupo

# Go inside the directory
cd grupo

# Install dependencies
yarn (or npm install)

# Start development server
yarn dev (or npm run dev)

# Build for production
yarn build (or npm run build)

# Start production server
yarn start (or npm start)
```
### Development mode

In the development mode, we will have 2 servers running. The front end code will
be served by the [webpack dev
server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which helps with hot
and live reloading. The server side Express code will be served by a node server
using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which helps in automatically restarting the
server whenever server side code changes.

### Production mode

In the production mode, we will have only 1 server running. All the client side
code will be bundled into static files using webpack and it will be served by
the Node.js/Express application.
